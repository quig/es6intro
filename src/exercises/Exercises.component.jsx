            We are so glad to have you here with us in this awesome journey we
            are about to start together :)
          </p>
          <p>
            Our goal is to introduce you to JavaScript and some awesome things
            you can do with the language. Don't worry if you've never done
            programming before, we'll start with the basics. For those of you
            already familiar with the language, you might want to skip few
            exercices and try some ES6 features.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each exercice will have a description of the expecting tasks and a
            codesandbox where you can code the anwser and see directly the
            outcome. Tests are automaticcaly run when the code is being
            modified. You can also open the codesandbox in another tab, then by
            creating an account, you can keep a copy of your work.
          </p>

            Have fun and please, don't choose <code>'Bulbizarre'</code> :/

          Programming consists in the manipulation of data. First, let's create
          some variables and bind to them values.

        <div>
          <ul>
            <li>

              and <code>'Carapuce'</code>
            </li>
            <li>
              Bind to <code>attackPoints</code> a number below or equal to 30
            </li>
            <li>
              Bind to <code>isMyPokemonTheBestEver</code> the keyword{" "}

          Pikachu is super cool, he has plenty of attacks and also statistics
          such as health points, attack, defense, speed. We could create several
          variables for each but instead, let's create an{" "}

          We could Calculate the damage every time we need but the actual
          formula is much more complexe. Instead create a function{" "}

          The evil rocket team has a new pokemon !!! A geodude !!! Thunder won't
          work on him as he is a ground pokemon. Modify the damage function to
          return 0 if thunder is used on a ground defender. Then modify it again
          to double the damage if the attacker uses surf. OK destroy the rocket
          team by launching a surf on all members one by one !!!
